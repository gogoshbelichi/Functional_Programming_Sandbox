/*
    1 Write a console app that calculates a user’s Body Mass Index (BMI):
        a Prompt the user for their height in meters and weight in kilograms.
        b Calculate the BMI as weight / height2.
        c Output a message: underweight (BMI < 18.5), overweight (BMI >= 25), or
    healthy.
        d Structure your code so that pure and impure parts are separate.
    2 Unit test the pure parts.
    3 Unit test the overall workflow using the function-based approach to abstract
away the reading from and writing to the console.
